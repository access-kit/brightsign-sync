# BrightSign Media Sync

Place the video file (H.264 .mp4/.mov) onto the SD card.  Then edit `config.json`, replacing the `<values>` with the appropriate data.

```
{
  "filepath"  : "<name of media file, including file extension>",
  "id"        : "<id to identify media player to server>",
  "syncURL"   : "<url for server to synchronize to>",
  "password"  : "<password for server to synchronize to>"
}

```
